                <p class="x4">Tanya grew up in a Mumbai suburb, like any normal teenager. <br> Unknown to her, a classmate from a previous school had started collecting information and pictures of her since they were 12. The information was then used to make a fake Facebook page, and was shown as if Tanya had posted them herself. Tanya had read about cyber bullying, but had never expected herself to be a victim. She found out about the fake page only through her friends.
                Even though the bullying seemed benign in the beginning, soon schoolmates started sending her crude messages and she became isolated from her friends circle. She withdrew to herself, rarely going out, and became depressed. The bullying then got so bad that she had to go for counseling and change schools to start afresh.
                 Having grown up around gadgets, children rely heavily on them to carry out everyday tasks.They also form their social persona around social media and depend on these websites to measure their acceptance by their peers.

                - Acknowledge that you have a social media addiction. Self-awareness is the first step towards recovery. <br>- Define specific goals for reducing your social media use. These goals could include limiting daily screen time or designating specific times for checking social media. <br>


                 - Use built-in screen time tracking features on your phone or install apps that track your social media usage. This will give you insights into how much time you're spending on social media. <br>

                - Turn off non-essential notifications for social media apps to reduce the constant urge to check your phone. <br>


                - Unfollow or mute accounts that trigger negative emotions or fuel your addiction. Curate your feed to be more positive and meaningful. <br>


                 - Fill the time you used to spend on social media with productive or enjoyable activities like reading, exercising, or pursuing a hobby. <br>


                - Use timers or app features that allow you to set daily time limits for social media use. When the time is up, close the app. <br>


                - Share your goals with a friend or family member who can help hold you accountable for your social media use. <br>


                 - Consider temporarily deleting social media apps from your phone to break the habit. You can still access them via a web browser if necessary. <br>


                - Install website blockers or productivity apps that restrict access to social media sites during specific hours. <br>


                - Learn mindfulness techniques to become more aware of your impulses and cravings. This can help you resist the urge to check social media mindlessly. <br>


                 - Reward yourself when you meet your goals. Celebrate your achievements with a small treat or by doing something you enjoy. <br>


                - If your addiction is severe, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction and digital well-being. <br>

                - Breaking an addiction takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself, and if you slip up, don't be too hard on yourself. Start again and keep working towards your goals.
